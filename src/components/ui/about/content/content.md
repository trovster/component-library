I am a web developer working with designers and
small agencies in and around the Midlands, UK.

I develop usable and accessible front-end interfaces using web standards,
including semantic HTML, CSS for layout and visual design, and JavaScript for
progressive user interface enhancements.

On the server side, I primarily develop using PHP and MySQL. I am confident developing
large scale applications using Laravel and solutions using WordPress.
